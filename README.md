## Under construction!

Hi! I'm Kevin Prunty. I'm currently a computer science student and I'm 
going through the steps to try and become a web developer. 

I figure using GitHub Pages would be a cool little project to experiment 
with new skills and also fiddle around with git and GitHub.

I'll get this running in my free time! I'll also practice making this README more useful, eventually.

This site was built using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
