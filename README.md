## Under construction!

Hi! I'm Kevin Prunty. I'm currently a computer science student and I'm 
going through the steps to try and become a web developer. 

I figure using GitHub Pages would be a cool little project to experiment 
with new skills and also fiddle around with git and GitHub. 

## Updates:

Currently on hiatus due to school, internship, and money problems.



### Old updates:
December 9, 2017: What you see here currently is just a bunch of me doing some experiments with my environment, really just messing around before I actually design very much. 

Once I figure out my current capabilities, I will design a simple portfolio to show off things I can do and present a summary. 

Maybe it'll convince someone to like me! Haha... ha.

I'll get this running in my free time! I'll also practice making this README more useful, eventually.
